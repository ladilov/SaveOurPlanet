                Save Our Planet is not an organization. We are just people who want 
                to live in a beautiful, prosperous nature. We do not force you to 
                do anything, we only ask you to take care of the place where we all 
                live.

                <p>Fire is an endless source of light and heat. He kept people warm 
                   for a long time and he keeps us warm to this day. But if the 
                   fire is not controlled, it can turn into a major problem that 
                   will be very difficult to solve.</p>

                <p>Garbage has always been a big problem. But only recently it has 
                   grown to incredible proportions. People managed to leave it 
                   everywhere - in the ocean, on land and even in space.</p>

                <p>
                    Deforestation has been common since ancient times. But nowadays, 
                    about 26 million hectares of forest are cut down a year. If 
                    this number is not reduced. Soon, our planet will have nothing 
                    to breathe.</p>

                <p>
                    Many chemicals are released into the atmosphere every day. They poison the air, making it 
                    difficult for people to breathe.</p>

                <p>It is very unpleasant for us to talk about it. But the main 
                    problem is people. Most of the problems with nature are caused 
                    by us. We want to pump everything out of the planet without 
                    giving it anything in return. We chop down, poison our house 
                    trying to cash in on it. But we are not ready for the 
                    consequences of our actions.</p>
